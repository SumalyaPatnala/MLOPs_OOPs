1. Class and Obj (example)
2. Class has data/attributes and functions/methods

Why Python is called OOP? - everything in Python is an object(datastructure like list , datatype like string/int)
Advantages of OOPs:
    > You can create your own datatype like how string, int or float is made.
    > Code reusability(preprocessing class can have multiple functions that can come handy in other classes)
    > Debugging
    > Easy to colab
